# Assembly


# -> Having an understanding of assembly language makes one aware of:

How programs interface with OS, processor, and BIOS;

How data is represented in memory and other external devices;

How the processor accesses and executes instruction;

How instructions access and process data;

How a program accesses external devices.



# -> Other advantages of using assembly language are:

It requires less memory and execution time;

It allows hardware-specific complex jobs in an easier way;

It is suitable for time-critical jobs;

It is most suitable for writing interrupt service routines and other memory resident programs.
